            <h3>Puente Del Diablo</h3> <img src="del diablo.jpg" alt="puente del diablo" class="center-img">
            Some call it <abbr title="To learn more about the legend"><a href="https://www.vigattintourism.com/tourism/articles/The-Tale-of-Puente-del-Diablo#google_vignette">Punta del Diablo.</a></abbr>  Yet, since punta is “point or up” in Spanish and the legend tells of a “bridge”, the proper terms seems to be the Spanish puente.
    Puente del Diablo in Binangonan, Rizal is actually a peninsular hill about 20 meters high extending out some 100 meters in to the waters of Laguna de Bay. During summer when it has no vegetation growing from its many crags and cracks, its huge somewhat rectangular rocks give it the appearance of a ruined massive stone-bridge.
    The legend of Puente del Diablo or the "devil's bridge" of Talim Island in Binangonan, Rizal is also the story of a young woman, her village, and how they find their strength in each other.
